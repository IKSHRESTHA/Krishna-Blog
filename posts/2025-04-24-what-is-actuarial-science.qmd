Actuarial science is a discipline that applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in insurance, finance, and other industries. It involves using quantitative techniques to evaluate future events and their financial implications.

The path to becoming an actuary typically involves obtaining a degree in actuarial science or a related field, followed by passing a series of professional exams to become certified. Actuaries are employed by insurance companies, pension funds, and other financial institutions to analyze data and develop policies that minimize risk and ensure financial stability.
