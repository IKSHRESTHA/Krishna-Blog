Actuaries use their expertise to help organizations make informed decisions about uncertain future events, such as life expectancy, accident rates, or financial market fluctuations.

Actuarial science combines knowledge from mathematics, probability, statistics, economics, and computer science. The work of actuaries is crucial for designing insurance policies, pension plans, and managing financial risk for companies and governments.
